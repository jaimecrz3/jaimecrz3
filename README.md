# Hi, I’m Jaime

I’m a **Mathematics + Computer Science** student/graduate focused on **quantitative finance**, **machine learning**, and **software engineering**.  
I enjoy building reproducible solutions to complex problems—combining mathematical modeling with practical engineering.

## What I’m looking for
- **Internship / Junior roles** in **Quantitative Finance (Quant Research / Trading / Risk / Portfolio)**, or **Software / ML Engineering**
- **Master’s programs** in **Quantitative Finance / Financial Engineering**, ideally with a strong **ML** component

## About me
- Strong foundation in **probability, statistics, optimization, linear algebra, and numerical methods**
- Comfortable turning ideas into working systems: **clean code, experimentation, evaluation, documentation**
- Interested in: **systematic strategies, time series modeling, market microstructure, risk modeling, ML for finance**

## Featured projects

- **[Machine Learning Coursework (Python/Notebooks)](https://github.com/jaimecrz3/applied-machine-learning-coursework)** — End-to-end notebook implementations of core ML paradigms: supervised learning (LogReg, SVM, Random Forest, Ridge), unsupervised learning (KMeans, DBSCAN), association rules (Apriori, FP-Growth), and deep learning in Keras (Fashion-MNIST CNNs, MNIST autoencoders).  
  _Keywords:_ classification, regression, clustering, association rules, deep learning | _Tech:_ Python, Jupyter, scikit-learn, Keras

- **[DGIIM — Coursework Index (UGR)](https://github.com/jaimecrz3/DGIIM)** — Curated and structured archive of projects, assignments, and labs from the Double Degree in **Computer Engineering + Mathematics** (University of Granada). Organized by academic year/track for fast navigation.  
  _Keywords:_ coursework, algorithms, systems, applied math | _Tech:_ multi-language (Python/C++/Java, etc.), Git

- **[Minimum Differential Dispersion Problem (MDDP) — Metaheuristics in C++](https://github.com/jaimecrz3/mddp-metaheuristics)** — Solves the NP-complete MDDP using trajectory-based metaheuristics (BMB, ILS, Simulated Annealing, ILS+SA, GRASP ± LS), including MDPLIB instances, CMake build, and experimental evaluation.  
  _Keywords:_ metaheuristics, combinatorial optimization, local search | _Tech:_ C++, CMake

- **[Skin Lesion Classification — Deep Learning Benchmarks](https://github.com/jaimecrz3/skin-lesion-classification-benchmarks)** — Benchmark study for melanoma/nevus/keratosis classification: self-supervised **ViT-DINO** (linear probe + fine-tuning), supervised ViT baselines, and CNN transfer learning (e.g., AlexNet/EfficientNet). Includes training pipelines, metrics, and a written report.  
  _Keywords:_ computer vision, medical imaging, self-supervised learning | _Tech:_ Python, PyTorch, ViT, CNNs | _Collaboration:_ developed with contributors (see repo contributors/PRs).

- **[TDA in Finance — Mapper (Bachelor’s Thesis)](https://github.com/jaimecrz3/tda-finance-mapper)** — Research code and experiments for applying **Topological Data Analysis** to high-dimensional financial data, centered on the **Mapper** algorithm (with optional extensions such as persistent homology / Ball Mapper).  
  _Keywords:_ TDA, high-dimensional data, financial data analysis | _Tech:_ Python, scientific stack

## Skills
- **Programming:** Python, C++, Java, Git
- **Data/ML:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, fastai
- **Quant/Math:** probability & statistics, optimization, time series, numerical methods
- **Engineering:** Linux, Docker, testing, CI, SQL, APIs

## Education
- **Mathematics and Computer Science**, University of Granada (Year 5 out of 5)  
  Relevant coursework: Probability, Statistics, Optimization, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Databases, Numerical Analysis, Mathematical Analysis, Algebra, Geometry, Computer Vision...
